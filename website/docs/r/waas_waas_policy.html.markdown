  Provides the Waas Policy resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Waas service

# oci_waas_waas_policy
This resource provides the Waas Policy resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Waas service.

Creates a new Web Application Acceleration and Security (WAAS) policy in the specified compartment. A WAAS policy must be established before creating Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules. To use WAF rules, your web application's origin servers must defined in the `WaasPolicy` schema.

A domain name must be specified when creating a WAAS policy. The domain name should be different from the origins specified in your `WaasPolicy`. Once domain name is entered and stored, it is unchangeable.

Use the record data returned in the `cname` field of the `WaasPolicy` object to create a CNAME record in your DNS configuration that will direct your domain's traffic through the WAF.

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the service to reside. For information about access control and compartments, see [Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).

You must specify a display name and domain for the WAAS policy. The display name does not have to be unique and can be changed. The domain name should be different from every origin specified in `WaasPolicy`.

All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including WAAS policies, receive a unique, Oracle-assigned ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When a resource is created, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource's OCID by using a list API operation for that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console. Fore more information, see [Resource Identifiers](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).

**Note:** After sending the POST request, the new object's state will temporarily be `CREATING`. Ensure that the resource's state has changed to `ACTIVE` before use.
