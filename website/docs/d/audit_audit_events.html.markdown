# Data Source: oci_audit_events
This data source provides the list of Audit Events in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Audit service.

Returns all audit events for the specified compartment that were processed within the specified time range.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_audit_events" "test_audit_events" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"
	end_time = "${var.audit_event_end_time}"
	start_time = "${var.audit_event_start_time}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The OCID of the compartment.
* `end_time` - (Required) Returns events that were processed before this end date and time, expressed in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp format. For example, a start value of `2017-01-01T00:00:00Z` and an end value of `2017-01-02T00:00:00Z` will retrieve a list of all events processed on January 1, 2017. Similarly, a start value of `2017-01-01T00:00:00Z` and an end value of `2017-02-01T00:00:00Z` will result in a list of all events processed between January 1, 2017 and January 31, 2017. You can specify a value with granularity to the minute. Seconds (and milliseconds, if included) must be set to `0`. 
* `start_time` - (Required) Returns events that were processed at or after this start date and time, expressed in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp format. For example, a start value of `2017-01-15T11:30:00Z` will retrieve a list of all events processed since 30 minutes after the 11th hour of January 15, 2017, in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). You can specify a value with granularity to the minute. Seconds (and milliseconds, if included) must be set to `0`.
* `limit` - (Optional) The number of pages of events to request from the service. Default to 1. Large `start_time` and `end_time` ranges or very active tenancies may result in very large data sets that could cause performance issues running Terraform commands. This default value mitigates that risk by requiring intentionally setting a higher tolerance for slow running Terarform commands with potentially large statefiles.
